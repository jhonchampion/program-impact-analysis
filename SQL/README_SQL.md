## SQL Transformation Pipeline (Sample – Hubs Component)

The M&E system was built using layered BigQuery views to ensure clean transformation, reproducibility, and automated longitudinal tracking.

⚠️ Note:
Due to data confidentiality (government-backed program), the SQL logic below uses sample structures and anonymized field names. Only the Hubs monitoring component is shown here as a demonstration subset of the full M&E system.
